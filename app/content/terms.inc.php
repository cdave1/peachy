PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY IT CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR (THE "CUSTOMER'S") RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS THAT MAY APPLY TO YOU. 
<br />
<br />
This Agreement contains the terms and conditions that apply to Customer's purchase from MovieHouse of Digital Media and/or related products ("Supplies") in New Zealand. By accepting delivery of the Supplies, Customer agrees to be bound by and accepts these terms and conditions. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY UNLESS THE CUSTOMER AND MovieHouse HAVE SIGNED A SEPARATE AGREEMENT COVERING THE PURCHASE OF THE SUPPLIES IN WHICH CASE THE SEPARATE AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN. 
<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li><b>Purchase.</b><br />
<br />Upon MovieHouse's acceptance of the Customer's order, a firm contract for the purchase and sale of the Supplies ordered, sold and/or distributed by MovieHouse will be formed between MovieHouse and Customer, and shall incorporate all the terms set forth herein. These terms and conditions shall NOT be altered or amended by the use of any document(s). Any attempt to alter this document or to enter an order for Supplies which are subject to additional and/or altered terms and conditions will become null and void, unless otherwise agreed to in a written agreement signed by both parties. 
<li><b>Order Acceptance.</b><br />
<br />All product orders are for use and delivery within New Zealand. ALL ORDERS PLACED BY CUSTOMER ARE SUBJECT TO ACCEPTANCE BY MOVIEHOUSE. 
<li><b>Delivery.</b><br />
<br />Delivery shall be subject to MovieHouse's <a href="<? echo $PAGES_PATH; ?>shipping.php">Shipping Policy</a> as set forth on this Website. 
<li><b>Warranty.</b><br />
<br />MovieHouse warrants that MovieHouse is the legal and rightful owner of the Supplies or that it is legally licensed and/or authorized to sell and/or distribute Supplies being purchased hereunder. All Supplies delivered hereunder will be free and clear of any and all encumbrances of any kind. You acknowledge that MovieHouse is not the manufacturer of any of the Supplies purchased hereunder. You shall be entitled to all manufacturers' product and patent infringement warranties associated with Supplies purchased by you hereunder. THIS WARRANTY SUPERSEDES ALL INCONSISTENT PROVISIONS OF ANY AND ALL PURCHASE ORDERS, INVOICES, ACKNOWLEDGMENTS, OR OTHER WRITINGS OR STATEMENTS, WRITTEN OR OTHERWISE. MOVIEHOUSE DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND PRODUCT LIABILITY, SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. 
<li><b>Limitation of Liability.</b><br />
<br />In no event will MovieHouse be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, whether based on contract, tort, or any other legal theory, including without limitation loss of data or its use, loss of profits, loss of business, or other economic damages, even if advised of the possibility of such loss or damage. 
<li><b>Returns.</b><br />
<br />MovieHouse's Unconditional Guarantee stands firmly behind every product it sells and every service it performs. Digital Media is refundable only if unopened. Defective media is exchangeable for the same title only. Special Order Service items are not returnable. Please consult our <a href="<? echo $PAGES_PATH; ?>faq.php">FAQ page</a> for information on how to return an item ordered from us.
<li><b>Pricing.</b><br />
<br />MovieHouse reserves the right to limit quantities and to refuse orders made from other Digital Media distributors. Although we intend to maintain our pricing throughout the life of our catalogs, we reserve the right to change prices and limit quantities due to changes in market conditions. Every effort is made for this catalog to be accurate. However, occasional posting errors may occur, thus MovieHouse reserves the right to bill for all Supplies at the prices that they deem to be correct. 
<li><b>Reservation of Rights.</b><br />
<br />MovieHouse reserves the right to change at any time without notice MovieHouse's terms and conditions of sale.
