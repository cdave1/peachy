No way - this is an early pre-alpha release. It is buggy and prone to crash if you do the wrong thing. It goes without saying that you
use peachy.ws at your own risk.<br /><br />
Upgrades and improvements will be made most days, late morning-ish (US time).
<br /><br />
Contact me <a href="mailto:david@peachy.co.nz">here</a> if you have any suggestions for improvements.
<br /><br />
Thanks!<br />
